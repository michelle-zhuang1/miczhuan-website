    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm Michelle Zhuang. I'm a former software engineer at Cisco on the Capital IT team, supporting the financial payment solutions for leasing and loans of Cisco hardware and software products. Utilizing Agile methods, I collaborate cross functionally with Finance, Operations, and Accounting teams to deliver key business requirements. Built and deployed automated workflows using UiPath to improved test automation and efficiency by 10%. Developed and implemented PL/SQL packages to fetch contract details for data ingestion and integration with InfoLease.</p>
    <p>I graduated from Swarthmore College with a double major in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. At Swarthmore, I have previously served as the President of Women in Computer Science club (WiCS) on campus, building a community to empower other women with a passion for technology. My passion for community building doesn't stop there. I was also a Resident Assistant, managing administrative duties, such as budgeting, and fostering a community among a cohort of ethnically diverse undergraduate students.</p>
    <p>I have a strong technical foundation and a passion for creative problem-solving. I pride myself on being a strong communicator and adaptable team player, navigating complex projects with resilience and an open-minded approach. Iâ€™m currently looking for [junior] software engineering roles where I can grow, contribute to impactful projects, and continue learning cutting-edge technologies.</p>
